# Mouse Thyroid in vitro scRNA-seq Analysis

Analysis code provided for mouse in vitro thyroid scRNA-seq dataset [Romitti, Eski et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427103v1)

The data can also be accessed at [Shiny App](https://sumeet.shinyapps.io/mouse-thyroid-invitro/)

Analysis folder contains codes for the analysis performed both in Seurat and Scanpy.

Files folder contains:
- documents necessary to run the pipeline (cell cycle gene list and immature/mature thyrocyte metadata info)
- metadata document to get cell information (cell type, leiden clusters and UMAP coordinates)
